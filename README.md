# setup
Sets a macOS machine up for a comfy dev environment

## what this configures
* Trackpad, keyboard, & inputs
* Bluetooth audio
* Screenshot prefs
* Finder & Dock
* Terminal
* Animations
* A million other little things

## what this installs
* Homebrew apps
* Mac App Store apps

## how
> sh mac-setup.sh

## next, remember to:
* open apps that require further setup, like Wavebox & Spotify
* clone dotfiles repo into your user directory (so your terminal gets set up too)
* set up SSH keys
* finish installing some Casks (they need to run proprietary installers deposited in usr/local/Caskroom)
* install apps that don't have Casks:
    * Adobe stuff mainly
    * Davinci Resolve
